- [Tracing](#tracing)
- [Networking visualization](#networking-visualization)

## Tracing

Using [this Katacoda scenario](https://katacoda.com/courses/opentracing/golang-hotrod-demo) you will deploy [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), a distributed tracing tool, and use it in the context of microservices.


## Networking visualization

Using [this Katacoda scenario](https://katacoda.com/courses/weave/installing-weave-scope-on-kubernetes) you will deploy [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/oss/scope/), allowing you to visualize containers running in a Kubernetes cluster as well as communication between them.
